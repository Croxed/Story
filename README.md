Story
=====

A rouge-like role-playing 2D game built with Slick2D.

The goal of this game is to create a fun simple experience in which parts of the game can be used as inspiration or even as a basis for other similiar games of a 2D nature. A good example of this is the cooldown system used in the game is modular enough to be used in other projects with only samll modifications and rules to remember. 



This project aims to be as open-source as possible.
Every asset or line that is written in this game shall be free to use, modify, fork, etc. I belive in the practice to give credit where credit is due and therefore shall every assets used in this game be mentioned and thanked.



So what does the future hold for Story?

- Talent system
- Iventory system
- Modular level implementation 
- Class system
- Chest, locks, buttons, levers, and much much more stuffs!
